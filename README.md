The translated text is added over language files and you will see a corresponding message in the client log for untranslated advancements like:
`Unable to translate summoned (advancement.minecraft.nether.summon_wither.summoned) to a more meaningful name.`

Example **en_us.json** entry for the former line:
`"advancement.minecraft.nether.summon_wither.summoned": "Summon a Wither",`

## 🙋FAQ

### Is this a server side / client side mod❓

Its a pure client side mode, but will not harm if it is installed on the server.

You can adjust the position in the config, most of the settings are updated live.
Other settings may need a client restart before showing up correctly.
